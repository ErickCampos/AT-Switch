# Blow-based AT Switch

This repo describes the construction of a blow-based AT switch. The device can
act as an independent trigger, and a minimal desktop *driver*, called **JATSD** 
(Jack AT Switch Driver) allow it to be used as a 'mouse click' interface, which
communicates with the computer directly via audio P2 3.5mm jack input.
