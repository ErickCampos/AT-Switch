# AT Switch

This repo describes the construction of non-conventional AT switches:
- Proximity-based, through IR LEDs and IR Sensors
- Puff-based, through piezoelectric disc sensors

The devices can act as independent triggers, and a minimal desktop *driver*,
called **JATSD** (Jack AT Switch Driver) allow them to be used as a 'mouse
click' interface, which communicates with the computer directly via audio P2
3.5mm jack input.
