# Proximity-based, Wireless AT Switch

## Content (hardware schematics)
- kicad-libs: HT12D, HT12E and Potentiometer (libraries required for Kicad)
- ir-led:     Emitter infrared LED signal circuit (it sends a command signal to the TV)
- tx:         Transmitter AT switch module circuit
- rx:         Receiver AT switch module circuit
- status-led: R/G/B LED circuit (system status)

All circuits were built on the KiCad software
